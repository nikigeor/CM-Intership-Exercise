Work / Project Examples

1. JobOffer(Joboffer.com) - Used Laravel Blade to create the pages of JobOffer.com, make sure all pages are fully responsive.
2. Acuspire(acuspire.ai) - Helped in Market Research to find the best content/styling for the website, making sure all pages are fully responsive on all                              devices.
3. Hive Workplace Consulting INC. - Particpated in creating the database using MongoDB to save users survey response, developed the front-end interface                                         using React.

Inspiration

The three works that have inspired me from a technical perspective would be some from three.js because of intense and beyond design can be and how appealing it is to users, CodePen/CodeSandbox because it shows what the outcome looks like and see how the code is excuting it, and lastly, MDN because its an excellent source to learn and shows what each functionality is doing. 

Focus

If given the oppournity to build/learn anything at CM, I would love to focus more on front-end development, however I am open to learning more on the full stack. I see myself as a visual learner and love to be creative, so based on my past projects I developed an interest on front-end development.
